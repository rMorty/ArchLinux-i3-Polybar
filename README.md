# ArchLinux-i3-Polybar
This is my i3+polybar configuration on Arch Linux, with Gnome as DE. The folders/files in this repo (except for the *screenshots* folder) should be put in your `$HOME/.config/`.

![S2](/screenshots/screenshot2.png)
The dependencies are:
- i3
- i3lock
- polybar
- rofi
- scrot
- starship
- picom
- siji-git
- ttf-fira-code
- otf-font-awesome
- autotiling
- feh  

> Be careful to change a few lines in the i3/config file to suit your needs: in particular line 8 for the keyboard layout and line 217 for the background
